# todomvc
This project is aimed for practicing various frameworks via building the simplest web app, Todo list.

Basically I read this [todomvc](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc) repo first to get a rough idea, then write my own code, finally compare it with original code and think what do I have to change.

Though it's largely based on [todomvc](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc), I try my best to write on my own. So there are differences, especially in tools.

This practice do improve my understanding of MVC! Keep going!
